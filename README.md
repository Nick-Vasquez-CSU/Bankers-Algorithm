### Banker's Algorithm

##### WHAT WE LEARNED
* How to utilize break, try, and error statements within an algorithm
* How to predict whether a certain sequence of instructions within an algorithm can be detected as being possible or impossible to fulfill
* How to manage the resource-request algorithm utilizing C++
* How to avoid deadlock within an operating system
* Tools: C++, Linux Terminal

##### HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
1. Download the repository and save it in a folder
2. Within the linux terminal, input the following command to run the algorithm: `g++ bankers_algorithm.cpp "INSERT TXT FILE NAME HERE" -o executable`
3. The txt files that can be loaded include: "bankers_large", "bankers_medium", "bankers_small", "bankers_tinier", and "bankers_tiny".
